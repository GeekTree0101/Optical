## Intro
Optical is a lightweight and predictable state management pattern framework for iOS

<img src="https://github.com/GeekTree0101/Optical/blob/master/screenshots/intro1.png" />

- [X] Find and fix bugs faster and easier.
- [X] Change existing behaviors with confidence.
- [X] Add new features easily.
- [X] **Write shorter** methods with single responsibility.
- [X] Extract business logic from view controllers into **opticle**.
- [X] Build **reusable** components with network services and utilities objects.
- [X] Write factored code from the start.
- [X] Write fast and **maintainable unit tests** with state base.
- [X] Have **confidence in your tests** to catch regression.

## Structures

### Workflow

<img src="https://github.com/GeekTree0101/Optical/blob/master/screenshots/intro2.png" />

- Dispatch: You can request network(backend) service or API and commit response for mutating state
```swift
  var service: NetworkService = .init()

  func dispatch(_ request: Request) {
    // do commit
    service.request(onSuccess: { [weak self] response in
      self?.commit(.success(response))
    })
  }
```
- Mutation: You can mutate currentState with utilities base on **previous state with response** from dispatcher
```swift
  var utility: SomeUtil = .init()

  func mutate(_ state: State, response: Response) {
    var newState = state
    newState.value = utility.makeValue(from: response)
    return newState
  }
```
- Watcher: You can **observe state**  changing from opticle
```swift
let opticle = SomeOpticle()

opticle.watch.live { newState in 
  print(newSate.value)
}

// you can observe state duplicately!
opticle.watch.live({ newState in 
  print("listen one more \(newSate.value)")
})

// you can observe state on other dispatch qos!
opticle.watch.live(on: DispatchQueue.global(.background), { newState in 
  print("background \(newSate.value)")
})

// Map & Fillter 
opticle.watch.map { $0.list }.filter { $0.count > 10 }.live({ list in 
  print("map & filter")
})
```

### Mutation & Recover

<img src="https://github.com/GeekTree0101/Optical/blob/master/screenshots/intro3.png" />

- Mutation: It will be called by success commit from dispatcher
- Recover: You can recover state base on error. it will be called by error commit from dispatcher

```swift
  func dispatch(_ request: Request) {
    // success
    self.commit(.success)
    
    // error
    self.commit(.failed(error), from: request)
  }
  
  func mutate(_ state: State, response: Response) {
    // .success only
  }
  
  func recover(_ state: State, request: Request, error: Error?) {
    // .failed from request
  }
```
